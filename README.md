# I have completed five pedals: 
#### 1. An emulation of the Marshall Guvnor.
#### 2. An emulation of Electro Harmonic's Big Muff Pi.
#### 3. A clone of the Dyna Compressor by MXR. 
For this pedal I made a few modifications by adding two switches which enable control over the attack and tone of the compressor.
#### 4. A clone of the Rat by ProCo. 
For this pedal I made a few modifications by adding a second set of diodes and a switch providing two modes for the pedal. When the switch is down, the signal is clipped by the diodes used in the original circuit (1n914's). When the switch is up, the signal is clipped by two Red LED's providing a harsher/louder sound. I like to call the second mode "rage mode" since the Red LED's (displayed outside of the enclosure) and switch look like two eyes and a rat nose. When the LED's or "eyes" clip the signal they light up red making it seem like the Rat is enraged.
#### 5. An emulation of Ibanez's first version of the Tubescreamer (TS808).
