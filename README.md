# Guitar-Pedals
So far I have completed two pedals. One emulation of the Marshall Guvnor and one emulation of Electro Harmonic's Big Muff Pi. Their schematics, breaboard layouts, and final designs can be found in their respective folders. I am now working on MXR's Dyna Compressor, currently at the breadboard/prototyping stage (will be updating it's progress here in due time).
