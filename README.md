# Guitar-Pedals
The only pedal I have completed entirely so far is the Marshall Guvnor. Its schematic, breaboard layout, and final product can be found in its folder. I am now working on the Big Muff Pi, currently at the breadboard/prototyping stage (will be updating it's progress here in due time). I have done some research on the ProCo Rat and am very excited to start working on it but I told myself I have to wait until I finish the Big Muff.
